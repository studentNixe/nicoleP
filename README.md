Hello World!
 
This project is just 4 fun. It is still in the stage of development.

It is a webapp created with node.js using the npm packages express and ejs (https://www.npmjs.com/).

To create the svg pictures I used my favourite drawing tool inkscape (https://inkscape.org/de/).

The icons I use in my profile sheet and e.g. for the menu items, come from fontawesome (http://fontawesome.io/icons/).

The project is deployed with now (https://zeit.co/now), so you may find it here (https://nicolepit.now.sh/).

Have fun,
Nicole P.
